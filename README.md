# Tabloid CLI

TabloidCLI is a console command line interface dashboard proof of concept application created as a group project in the fall of 2022 as part of the NewForce coding school curriculum.

TabloidCLI is an app where you can add, list, remove, and edit blog  posts, notes, tags, authors, blogs and journal entries. Each blog, author or post entry can be assigned a tag. A search function is included to search data by tag.

Data categories are organized into tables stored in a SQL database and accessed through the application via ADO.NET. The project was planned in Figma, issue tickets were tracked in Trello and the application was built in Visual Studio.

## The Story

"Hey, let's start a company," you say.

"Ok. Let's do it. What should our company do?"

"Well..." you begin, "what do people need? What will they find valuable?"

"I know I always need help keeping things organized."

"Yeah," you say, pondering the idea. "Organization. That's good. What should we organize? ...I know: Blog Posts!"

"Great idea!"

"We'll make millions!"

## The Tabloid Proof of Concept

Our new business will create a software product to allow people save info about favorite blog posts, authors and blogs.

In order to test the new business idea, we'll create a [Proof of Concept (POC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept#Software_development). This POC will be a simplified implementation of the idea that will be used to test the business idea to ensure that customers would find it valuable, and also to allow the team to get a handle on the concept. After we complete the POC we will use it to evaluate our business idea and determine if we need to pivot (change direction) toward another idea.

For our POC, we will build a command line app in C# and save our data in SQL Server.

The ERD for the POC is provided below
